### v0.14.1 - 16 Dec 2022
    *  update TF API for newer versions
    *  supporting newer TF versions should solve some issues with installation via bioconda that would make it impossible to install the latest version under some configurations when using tensorflow-gpu
    *  warn when preprocessing sequences longer than expected and ask the user to explicitly enable trimming (--trim)
    *  add negative and undefined outputs in filter: now you can automatically get also the non-positive reads (see rki_bioinformatics/DeePaC#3).
    *  small refactors and bugfixes

### v0.13.0 - 13 Oct 2020
    *  skip connections
    *  confidence thresholds for predictions
    *  MC dropout for Bayesian uncertainty
    *  custom weight initialization schemes

    *  bugfix: Fwd and rc filter instances in filter contributions
    *  bugfix: correct custom weight initialization
    *  minor bugfixes

### v0.12.2 - 13 Jul 2020
    *  utilities: gff3 to .genome conversion tool, get builtin models
    *  extended filter enrichment analyses
    *  L1 option
    *  bugfixes
    *  UI/config improvements (last epoch is inclusive)

### v0.12.1 - 2 Jul 2020
    *  Treat forward and reverse-complement instances of filters separately when checking filter enrichment (detects more instances)
    *  Bugfixes

### v0.12.0 - 15 May 2020
    *  Extended multi-GPU support, easy GPU placement
    *  TPU support (experimental)
    *  Alternative distributed computation strategies (experimental)
    *  TFRecord training
    *  Cleaner config files, CLI improvements
    *  Additional debugging options
    *  Bugfixes

### v0.11.0 - 5 May 2020
    *  Full TensorFlow 2 compatibility (eager exec disabled for SHAP)
    *  Generate templates with deepac templates
    *  CLI tweaks
    *  Dynamic subread generation in training
    *  Bugfixes

### v0.10.1 - 20 Feb 2020
    *  Added workaround for a libgomp importing bug present on some systems (including bioconda's mulled-test containers)

### v0.10.0 - 19 Feb 2020
    New functionalities:
    *  convolutional filter visualization with partial Shapley values (max-contribution or all-contributions) or max-activation
    *  genome-wide phenotype potential maps
    *  nucleotide contribution maps
    *  filter enrichment analysis
    *  filter and gene rankings

    Other:
    *  TF 1.15 required; TF 2.0 compatible with training and prediction but untested, as TFExplainer in SHAP not yet compatible (so the intepretability workflows require TF<2.0)
    *  Minor bugfixes

### v0.9.3 - 13 May 2019
    *  Automated tests
    *  Bugfix: always saving models trained on built-in architectures
