    *  Full TensorFlow 2 compatibility (eager exec disabled for SHAP)
    *  Generate templates with deepac templates
    *  CLI tweaks
    *  Dynamic subread generation in training
    *  Bugfixes

### v0.10.1 - 20 Feb 2020
    *  Added workaround for a libgomp importing bug present on some systems (including bioconda's mulled-test containers)

### v0.10.0 - 19 Feb 2020
    New functionalities:
    *  convolutional filter visualization with partial Shapley values (max-contribution or all-contributions) or max-activation
