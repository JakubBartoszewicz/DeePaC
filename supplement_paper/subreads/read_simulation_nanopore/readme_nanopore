# workflow or how to use the scripts
1) read simulation using the Simulate and SimulationWrapper.R scripts   
   use only two workers otherwise not all reads are simulated
   folder containing DeepSimualtor installation needs to be in the same dir as the r-scripts
2) python scripts for further processing of the reads
2.1) combine_reads.py to combine the simulated reads into one fasta
     script has options for length filtering and extracting only subreads
     further processing using deepac preproc
2.2) read_sim_nanopore.py and count_reads.py
     used when first testing DeepSimulator
